Howard Hinnant's example short_alloc (stack-based allocator) that demonstrates allocators in a short and sweet manner

Just note: the allocator will only reuse memory on the stack (arena), 
if allocate, deallocate sequences have stack-based order (push-pop sequence). Otherwise it will just leave the memory "already-reserved"; 
which is not a big dead, since it's on the stack (arena) anyway and does not need to be deleted.
